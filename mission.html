    <meta name="description" content="Assured Care Consulting Inc - With rapidly changing regulations and market conditions in the seniors living and care markets, it has become increasingly difficult for small to medium sized operators to keep up and compete with larger chains, who have in-house expertise. Assured Care Consulting and Assured Care Management were created to provide support and value added services to meet the specific needs of these operators. Our team, of seasoned professionals, work closely with our clients to provide innovative and result oriented solutions to problems in all areas of operations. We believe in developing a strong ongoing relationship with our clients, which provides a solid foundation for  long term business success.">
